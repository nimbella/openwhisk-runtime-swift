# This build invokes the default ActionLoop build for swift when run remotely.
# Note that it works when (1) there is a Package.swift and Sources (the multi-file case)
# or (2) when there is a single .swift file.  It exits with an error otherwise.
# It is my impression that this limitation is inherent in /bin/compile for swift.
